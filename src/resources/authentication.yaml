intermediary:
  # Intermediary is the middleman between the Nakurity Backend and the Nakurity Client
  host: "127.0.0.1"

  # Authentication for the entire relay integration
  auth_token: "super-secret-token"

  # The queue for the neuro integration messages to be relayed back and forth
  # (from the neuro backend to the neuro integration via the nakurity backend)
  relay_queue: "relay_message_queue.pkl"

nakurity-backend:
  # The Nakurity Backend acts as an Neuro Backend Server, that relays information
  #   to the real neuro backend via the intermediary server.

  # This is done to help neuro manage multiple integrations connected to her at once.

  # Neuro OS is meant to use Neuro Relay to help manage multiple neuro integrations being
  #   to the neuro backend

  port: 8001

nakurity-id:
  # The Nakurity ID Server is supposed to be used to create a more compatible idenification
  # environment for neuro integrations working with the Nakurity Backend, without requiring
  # complete rewrite of the Neuro Integration for Neuro Relay.

  # This is used to help the Nakurity Backend idenifiy neuro integrations better for the neuro
  # backend, since neuro integrations can have the same name. (Also this is a http server)
  host: "127.0.0.1"
  port: 3032

nakurity-client:
  # The Nakurity Client is the single integration that should be connected to neuro at a time
  # To allow relay messages back and forth
  host: "127.0.0.1"
  port: 8000

dependency-authentication:
  neuro-os:
    # This is the authentication token you have to set for neuro-os to use, this is the most
    # important authentication token. Since Neuro OS has special access to the Neuro Relay
    # Intermediary Server, Neuro OS also hosts the admin dashboard for Neuro Relay, so if this
    # is compromised, all other neuro integrations can be compromised and misused.
